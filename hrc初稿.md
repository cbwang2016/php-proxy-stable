# Introduction to the Committee
## Introduction of the Council

## Illustration of the Topic
LGBT is an acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender. The word LGBT is often used to refer to the LGBT community, which originated from the ‘’gay community’’, a term that did not conclude all the minorities under the Gender and Sexuality spectrums. Besides the listed four terms, the LGBT community also includes queer, intersex, asexual, allies, and pansexual (LGBTQIAAP).

In order to shape the society on its view on LGBT, it is crucial to understand the reasons people have to be opposed to the LGBT community. It is important to think about the ways to influence people and change their views on LGBT.

To some degree, "gay rights" and "gay liberation" were both complementary and contradictory: rights could be viewed as a step to liberation, but many liberationists saw equal rights as a limited goal that did not address the fundamental problems in the society, such as homophobia, sexism, racism, and poverty.

Movements advocating the rights of LGBT people in the worldwide developed after World War II and have grown in size, diversity, and visibility since the Stonewall Riots of 1969. Central to these movements has been "identity politics," by which individuals adopt the very category used to deny them equality and organize as members of a minority group around that category.

Like women of all races or nonwhites of both sexes, homosexuals have routinely experienced legal discrimination in such areas as employment, housing, and health care, and have been victims of harassment and violence. The homophile movements of the 1950s and 1960s laid important foundations for addressing this situation by forming the first groups and publications to last, and by devising ideas and strategies that have been used since that time in the struggle for LGBTQ equality.

# History of Discrimination on the LGBT
After suffered from centuries of shame, suppression and secrecy in many cultures and religions, LGBT finally have been pursued and interwoven into more mainstream historical narratives in recent decades.

## Typical Cases of Negative History
Transgender and third gender people have been recorded in almost all cultures across human history. Discriminating view of LGBT people has instilled to some people in their cultural or religious context. Here are some negative historical and cultural events for reference.

1075 BCE – a Code from Middle Assyrian Empire prescribes castration for soldiers caught engaging in passive male-to-male intercourse and a ban on homosexual rape. The punishment for both laws is castration. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male same-sex intercourse in the military and homosexual rape.

**7th century BCE**\nl
Marriage between men in Greece was not legally recognized.

**5th century BCE**\nl
486 BCE – Darius I adopted the Holiness Code of Leviticus for Persian Jews of the Achaemenes Empire, enacting the first state sanctioned death penalty for male same-sex intercourse.

**12th century**\nl
1102 – The Council of London took measures to ensure that the English public knew that homosexuality was sinful.\nl
1120 – Baldwin II of the Kingdom of Jerusalem convened the Council of Nablus to address the vices within the Kingdom. The Council called for the burning of individuals who perpetually commit sodomy.\nl
1179 – The Third Lateran Council of Rome issued a decree for the excommunication of sodomites.\nl

**15th century**\nl
1424 – Bernardino of Siena preached for three days in Florence, Italy againsted homosexuality and other forms of lust, culminating in a pyre in which burned cosmetics, wigs and all sorts of articles for the beautification. He called for sodomites to be ostracized from society. And these sermons alongside measured by other clergy of the time strengthen opinion against homosexuals. They encouraged the authorities to increase the measures of persecution.\nl
1432 – In Florence the first organization specifically intended to prosecute sodomy is established, the "Night Officials", which over the next 70 years arrest about 10,000 men and boys, succeeding in getting about 2,000 convicted, with most then paying fines.\nl
1475 – In Peru, a chronicle written under the government describes the persecution of homosexuals with public burnings and destruction of homes (a practice usually reserved for conquered tribes).\nl
1483 – The Spanish Inquisition began. Sodomites were stoned, castrated, and burned. Between 1540 and 1700, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for sodomy.

**16th century**\nl

1558–1563 – Elizabeth I reinstated Henry VIII's old laws, including the Buggery Act 1533.

## Religious Origin and Attitude
Opposition to LGBT rights is often associated with conservative religious views. Society’s culture of facing sex and gender attitude was also related to religions in ancient times. As with social attitudes in general, religious attitudes towards homosexuality vary between and among religions and their adherents. Traditionalists among the world's major religions generally disapprove of homosexuality, and prominent opponents of social acceptance of homosexuality often cite religious arguments to support their views.

Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Islam, and various denominations of Christianity, traditionally forbid sexual relations between people of the same sex and teach that such behavior is sinful. Among Indic religions (also known as Dharmic religions), including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear. However, most contemporary religious authorities in the various Dharmic traditions view homosexuality negatively, and when it is discussed, it is discouraged or actively forbidden. Among the Sinic religions of East Asia, including Confucianism, folk religion and Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.

### Christianity
Christian denominations have a variety of beliefs about LGBT people, and the moral status of same-sex sexual practices and gender variance. LGBT people may be barred from membership, accepted as laity, or ordained as clergy, depending on the denominations.

#### Catholicism
The Catholic Church accepts people attracted to the same sex, while maintaining its teaching that homosexual relationships and acts are sinful. The Catholic Church considers transgender individuals to be their biological sex and admits no distinction between "sex" and "gender".

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states\nl *"men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies ... must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity."*\nl Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided." They oppose criminal penalties against homosexuality. The Catholic Church requires those who are attracted to people of the same (or opposite) sex to practice chastity, because it teaches that sexuality should only be practiced within marriage, which includes chaste sex as permanent, procreative, heterosexual, and monogamous.

#### Eastern Orthodoxy
Eastern Orthodoxy holds similar views to the Catholic Church on homosexuality. Protestant denominations have a wide range of views. All sexual relations outside of traditional marriage between a man and a woman are sinful, such as the Reformed Church in America, Southern Baptist Convention, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses. Others, such as the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Lutheran Church of Denmark, the Lutheran Church in Norway, the Lutheran Church of Iceland, the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, the German Lutheran and United Churches in Evangelical Church in Germany do not consider same-sex relations immoral, and will ordain LGBT clergy and do blessings of same-sex unions.

Historically, from the earliest days, Christians have taught that same-sex acts are contrary to Biblical teaching. The teachings of various church groups through the past centuries are surveyed in an article on the history of Christianity and homosexuality.

Christian objections to homosexual behavior are based upon their interpretations of the Bible. Some Biblical scholars interpret Genesis 19:5 as indicating that homosexual activity led to the destruction of the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Other Biblical passages that some interpret as addressing the issue of homosexual behavior include Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, etc.

#### Other churches
In opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible, and the meaning of texts related to homosexual acts, while often seeing what they call the diminishing of the authority of the Bible by many homosexual authors as being ideologically driven.

As an alternative to a school-sponsored Day of Silence opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying "As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect." Others created a Day of Dialogue to oppose what they believe are the "silencing" of Christian students who make public their opposition to homosexuality.

### Islam
Islamic views on homosexuality are influenced by the rulings prescribed by the Qur'an and the teachings of the prophet Muhammed. The mainstream interpretation of Qur'anic verses and *Hadith* condemn sexual acts between members of the same sex (along with most forms of extramarital relations). In contrast, transsexual individuals are often more accepted; for example, the Iranian government not only allows and recognizes sex reassignment surgery, but also subsidizes the procedure for transgender citizens.

#### Interpretations of the *Quran* in Relation to Homosexuality
According to the laws found guilty of homosexual acts should repent rather than confess citation needed. While some interpret this as permission to tolerate homosexuality, it is not allowed in Islam. Many Muslim scholars have followed this idea of a "don't ask, don't tell" policy in regards to homosexuality in Islam, by treating the subject with passivity. Comparisons have been made between the imperative nature of the secrecy of homosexual acts and the secrecy of women in many Islamic societies. In other words, women have to live under a certain amount of secrecy, and homosexuals must keep all of their transgressions and acts a secret.

#### The *Hadith*
The *Hadith* (the way of life prescribed as normative for Muslims on the basis of the teachings and practices of Muhammad and interpretations of the Koran) showed that homosexuality was not unknown in Arabia. However the Qur'an is allegedly vague regarding the punishment of homosexual sodomy. The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.

### Indian Religions
Hindu views of homosexuality and, in general, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues are diverse and different Hindu groups have distinct views. Homosexuality is regarded as one of the possible expressions of human desire. Although some Hindu dharma texts contain injunctions against homosexuality, a number of Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in homosexual sex. Same-sex relations and gender variance have been represented within Hinduism from Vedic times through to the present day, in rituals, law books, religious or so-called mythical narratives, commentaries, paintings, and sculpture. The extent to which these representations embrace or reject homosexuality has been disputed within the religion as well as outside of it.

Among the religions that originated in India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, homosexuality is rarely discussed, although contemporary religious authorities tend to view homosexuality negatively. Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas often refer to people of a third gender, who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay, transgender or intersex identities. This third sex is also negatively valued as a pariah class in some texts.

### Buddhism
Within the earliest monastic texts such as the Vinay a (c. 4th century BCE), male monks are explicitly forbidden from having sexual relations with any of genders. The Buddha's proscriptions against certain types of people joining the monastic sangha (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous; in some cases, this is explicitly stated. Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.

### Judaism
The subject of homosexual behavior and Judaism dates back to the Torah. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males.

#### Applicability of Biblical Death Penalty
Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the death penalty, though minors under 13 years of age are exempt from this as from any other penalty. However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.

Classical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual attraction is inherently sinful. However, someone who has had homosexual intercourse is considered to have violated a prohibition. If he does, he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions. Then he is seen to be forgiven by God.

#### Lesbian sexual activity
The reason why lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible is impossible to know and has become a matter of interpretation. Suggestions range from the idea that in ancient times only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women.

Sexual liaisons between women are, however, viewed as forbidden by most rabbis. This view is based on an interpretation of the Biblical verse "Do not follow the ways of Egypt where you once lived, nor of Canaan, where I will be bringing you. Do not follow any of their customs."

The Talmud prohibits any activity which it defines as lesbian. The main concern in the Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry a member of the priesthood. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin or made them a harlot. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation rather than the death penalty.

### Cultural Origin
There are many reasons in ancient times that cause the discrimination and violent against LGBT. And some reasons made some cultures of societies maintain the unacceptable opinion.Here are four typical reasons.
* The legalization of same-sex marriage undermines the traditional ethics.\nl Marriage is the most basic unit in the most civilized society, and the important embodiment of social ethics. Regardless of how the world, people have long followed a marriage definition of a man and a woman.
* The legalization of same-sex marriage undermines the basic function of some countries’ family.\nl Marriage is not just about sexual relationships and natural attributes, but also about other factors. Marriage and family have distinct ethical and national characteristics, and a country's history, tradition, culture, and a nation's way of thinking, value orientation, and aesthetic taste are closely related.
* Same-sex marriage and family unfit for healthy growth of young people.\nl If homosexuals could legally marry, their children would be fed more information about homosexuals, thereby encouraged them to choose same-sex partners as partners and changed the child's sexual orientation later in the day. Homosexuality was not a human survival and development of the favorable choice, people couldn’t let the children after the normal gene depth influenced by the concept of homosexuality, and these children was not fair.
* Same-sex marriage legalization will lead to a sharp increase in the number of homosexuals, triggering the Domino effect.
On one hand, gay marriage once legalized, gay people will be transferred from underground to the ground, from covert to open, the possibility of the emergence of new homosexuals will greatly increase. Because under the protection of the law, homosexuals can legally lure, pursue non homosexuals, so that homosexuals are not bold attempt homosexual behavior. Moreover, the education department will have to homosexuality as a normal way of life to the inculcation education, juvenile stage is in shaping the values of life, education that is detrimental to their sexual orientation.

On the other hand, the legalization of same-sex marriage may also cause a deep impact on the marriage system, that is, "Domino effect". Once same-sex marriage has been legalized, the next step may lead to the issue of "multilateral marriage", etc.

# Commonly Violated Rights of the LGBT Community
Basic human rights of the LGBT community, including the right to life, are commonly violated from place to place, due to discrimination, exerted by some sexual majority communities, derived from complex cultural and religious background. This part of background guide would focus on specific conditions where those violations take places as well as ongoing efforts and campaigns to eliminate them.

## Right to Life
Right of life, the right to sustain one’s life without being killed by other individuals in the society, has long been considered as a very basic human right of human being. However, in some corners of the world, such right of the LGBT community was severely threatened by both state and non-state actors.

### State Actors
There exist at least eight countries, codified by the UN, where death penalty is threatened to be exerted on individuals exercising homosexuality according to local legislative systems. However, specific conditions vary: some of those states with such penal codes have no record on executions; while some countries without such penal codes have records of executions. It is clear that all the state actors criminalizing homosexual relationships and behaviors and exerting capital punishment to recognized criminals are Islamic countries, with population mainly comprised of Muslims and jurisdiction system significantly affected by the *Shari'a*. *Shari'a* is an Islamic legislative system derived from *Quran* and *Hadith* (the opinion and interpretation of Muhammad on *Quran*), which regulates behaviors of Muslims. In Islamic ideology, homosexuality is considered as a sin and an act of disobeying the will of God . *Shari'a* influences legislation and jurisdiction system of Islam countries in various ways:\nl
in Saudi Arabia, a country profoundly influenced by fundamentalist Islam ideology, *Shari'a* shall be directly placed as penal code even without parallel secular laws; in addition with *Shari'a* courts using bench trial that are ignorant to procedural justice , persons alleged of committing sodomy, lesbianism or adultery would be easily sentenced to capital punishment;\nl
in some occasions, the content of constitution or penal codes of an Islam state shall be profoundly affected by Shari'a or even act as a specification and interpretation of *Shari'a*, thus capital punishment exerted on homosexuals shall be directly written down as a law (the Iranian Penal Code, for example, is composed of specifications of *Shari'a* and complements of *Shari'a*);\nl
in other occasions, *Shari'a* shall be regulated or acquiesced as parallel or complementary laws implemented with other secular laws, and thus death penalty shall be exerted on homosexuals without homosexuality being criminalized in the state’s penal code (e.g. Qatar).

**Extrajudicial killings from law enforcement forces of governments in Islamic states and other nations frequently take places around the globe but are mostly acquiesced by homophobic authorities and lack reports.**

### Norn-state Actors
Beside capital penalty sentenced and executed by state actors according to *Shari'a*, attacks initiated by homophobia non-state actors shall be an even greater threat to the LGBT community for its randomness and unpredictability.

Some of such attacks and assaults are linked with extreme Islamic ideology similar to the cause of capital punishments mentioned above. These attacks shall be initiated by unorganized individuals with relative extreme ideology or organizations seeking for promotion of their influence and idea and are sometimes accompanied by the ignorance of local authority.

The Orlando attack, for example, which took place in a homosexual nightclub on June the 12th, 2016, caused 49 deaths and was recognized by the U.S. government and media as the severest attack since *911*, was initiated by an Afghan American who believes in ideas proposed by the “Islamic State” and thus hated homosexuals. However, no evidence indicate any direct relationship between the “ISIS” and the attack, which imply that the shooter initiated the attack without direct operational order from the “ISIS” but radical opinion and hate developed under their influence.

The “ISIS”, recognized as a non-state actor and terrorist group, has great quantity of records on sentencing and executing suspected homosexuals within its territory. It has organized systematic persecution and massacre aiming at homosexuals: homosexuals are detected through stolen public media accounts or electronic devices and reports from local residents, even their relatives---hates of homosexual are wide spread in society of Syria and Iraq. Arrested homosexuals are sometimes tortured to reveal the name and location of their friends. *Shari'a* courts appointed by the “ISIS” would then sentence their crime of sodomy or lesbianism publicly and execute them immediately after it. Common way of execution is to throw the “prisoners” off the roof of buildings, and, in case they are dead, crowds surrounding the building will stone them to death. This cruel way of execution was declared to be able to cleanse the criminals of their sin. The processes of execution were often recorded as videos or photos and published to the internet for propaganda uses. Other local militia factions, even those fighting against the “ISIS” have records of torturing and persecuting homosexuals as well. And thus lots of homosexuals live under the control of the “ISIS” escaped to surrounding countries for living.

Apart from Islamic countries and population, more countries are threatening the right to life of the LGBT population in other indirect ways. Ignorance of the authority on assaults aiming at the LBGT community appears to one important cause. Kyrgyzstan, for example, ratified an anti-gay propaganda law which unleashed violate campaigns aiming at the LGBT community in 2014. After the law came into force, the record of violent attacks aiming at the LGBT community increased for about 300%. The passage of such law in Kyrgyzstan was believed to be influenced by the Russia, who has similar law currently. In other countries, even without such laws, the LGBT community is often subject to gender-based violence and killings with their governments failed to adequately prevent, to investigate and/or to prosecute such incidents.

### Struggles on the Protection of the Right to Life of the LGBT community
Facing tremendous threat on their right to life, countless brave individuals from the LGBT community along with their sympathizers around the globe never stopped their campaign. Organizations seeking for equal human rights, especially the right to life, are formed and keep campaigning by organizing demonstrations and reporting acts of violation to raise the awareness and call for supports from the society. Governments of countries around the globe had fierce arguments concerning relative topics on different frameworks of the UN system. In the year of 2010, a draft resolution concerning extrajudicial execution was proposed in the Third Committee of the General Assembly, numbered as A/C.3/65/L.29/Rev.1. However, an amendment proposed by Mali and Morocco, on behalf of the African and Arabian States, proposing the deletion of a part of an operative clause specifically as:\nl
*“In operative paragraph 6 (b), replace any discriminatory reason, including sexual orientation with discriminatory reasons on any basis,”*\nl
was passed and directly made the resolution ineffective. In the year of 2014, a resolution aiming the same target as the previous one was passed by the GA3, numbered as A/C.3/69/L.47/Rev.1. The resolution includes the following clause directly aiming at the prevention of extrajudicial executions caused by discrimination and persecution derived from sexual orientation and gender identification:\nl
*“**To ensure the effective protection of the right to life of all persons to conduct, when required by obligations under international law, prompt, exhaustive and impartial investigations into all killings**, including those targeted at specific groups of persons, such as racially motivated violence leading to the death of the victim, killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities or because of **their sexual orientation or gender identity**,”*\nl
which was considered as a milestone on the process of struggling for equal right to life for the LGBT community.It is remarkable that **NGOs** made extraordinary contributions on the passage of such a draft resolution, specifically by passing an open letter to the member states of the GA3.

## Rights in Social Life
### Right of Marriage
The Ruling in the case Obergefell v. Hodges from the Supreme Court of the U.S. attracts attention from around the world, which, made according the Constitution, declared the legitimacy of same-sex marriage in all 50 states of the U.S. and joined the U.S. with 20 other nations that have recognized same-sex marriage in laws. The initial purpose of same-sex marriage is exactly the same as heterosexual marriage: love and celebration of commitment. Thus, it is believed by the supporters that the state of marriage would provide a state of love, stability and happiness for individual engaging it, and thus the process of pursuing such condition is an act of love and pursuit of happiness which is part of the basic human rights every individual was born with. On the other hand, studies have adduced statistics that sexual minority individuals living in society that bans same-sex marriage are likely to be mentally unhealthy with the rate of various kinds of psychiatric disorders incline considerably.

Moreover, the state of marriage stands for legal and social bindings between individuals. Rights and protections such as heritage, divorce, adoption, immigration and so are provided with the recognition of the state of marriage. The rights of sharing properties, sharing nationality, raising children and even terminating the relationship adequately and legally are deemed essential for sexual minorities.  However, the legitimacy of promoting same-sex marriage remained controversial due to cultural and ideological diversity derived from the history.

### Right of Enjoying Equal Employment Opportunities

The LGBT community often finds themselves facing difficulties in different employment engaging processes, from hiring to firing. Discrimination during the process of hiring appears to be common, that homophobic employers tend not to hire individuals from the LGBT community. Applicators with minor sexual orientation or gender identification thus often hide their sexuality in order to gain equal employment rights comparing to others. It is reported that 34% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the UK choose not to disclose their sexuality at work.  Reports from the LGBT community have also showed that their sexualities are apt to be obstacles for their promotion on positions or salary level. LGBT employees are also vulnerable in workplaces, especially after revealing their own sexualities: they are likely to be excluded or harassed by colleagues. Employees indentifying themselves as LGBT may all face unfair salary level. Revealing sexualities may even cause firings of LGBT employees, and such action not outlawed or even recognized in vast majority of countries around the globe.

Few governments have implemented acts or policies to protect rights in the workplace of the LGBT community. In 2013, the United States Senate has voted to advance the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (abbreviated as the ENDA), passed originally in 1994, to outlawed acts of sacking or harassing employees for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Such promotion has improved the overall working condition of the LGBT community dramatically. In Japan, discrimination over sex minority was added as a form of harassment to the guideline for employers. The guideline was set up according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Law to regulate employers from violating rights of employees.  However, in most of other countries, almost no attention, study or policy was raised on such problem.

### Right of Enjoying Social Welfares
Health care, as a very basic part of social welfare, deeply affects life of every individual in the society, including the LGBT community. Due to their overall position in the society, they share several common difficulties on enjoying medical services and suffer from some same illnesses; due to specialized physical and mental conditions, different parts of the LGBT community are specifically vulnerable to certain illnesses and diseases.

Living in society with the mainstream of heterosexuals, the LGBT community is inevitably excluded in some respect. Thus, the mental condition of the LGBTs would be extraordinary vulnerable: psychiatric disorders and depressions are commonly seen in the community. Unhealthy mental conditions could lead to further conditions: anxiety and depression shall lead to suicide or substance abuse; the latter one shall then lead to infections of the HIV/AIDS. The exclusion of society shall also lead to poor living and financial condition, which would push some of the LGBTs to become sex-workers, and would increase the threat of infecting HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Poor living conditions would also result in no regular diagnoses, which make the health condition of the LGBT community even more vulnerable.

Lesbians are particularly vulnerable to breast cancers comparing to other female. At meantime, the promotion of routine Mammography, the most efficient way to discover and assess the cancer in its most curable period, is in great deficiency.  Gays are particularly vulnerable to Sex Transmitted Diseases (STDs), including the Hepatitis, HIV and HPV; the Hepatitis and HPV appear with no symptom immediately after infection, but can be potentially fatal. Two out of three kinds of Hepatitis can be prevented by immunization; both kinds of virus can be detected; so regular diagnoses are critical to the health condition of gays as well.  Transgender patients shall face refusals while seeking for medical service due to homophobia, transphobia or lack of experience and knowledge. In some conditions, the price of gender reassignment surgery may not be covered in the health insurance, though regulated in the *Yogyakarta Principles* that the cost of such treatments shall be paid by the states.

Apart from medical service, the right of enjoying education is another basic and critical right of individuals in the society. Proper education can be an essential factor of a successful life. However, it is reported that though LGBT rights have been more and more widely acknowledged by the society, schools, as miniature societies, are still “unfriendly” to children who recognize themselves as or was conceived by others as LGBTs. Harassment aiming at such students counts twice as much as that aiming at other students both verbally and physically. Under such conditions, negative educational outcomes of the LGBT children were presented. Programs and campaigns have struggled to break such barrier for the LGBT children. However, more efforts are still needed.

# Existing Relevant Laws and Codes
## Existing Relevant Laws and Codes Supporting Homosexual Behaviors
### *Denmark's registered partnership law (Denmark)*
**Time**: On 7 June 1989

**Content**: Registered partnerships had almost all the same qualities as marriage. All legal and fiscal rights and obligations were like those of opposite-sex marriage, with the following two exceptions:
* Laws making explicit reference to the sexes of a married couple did not apply to registered partnerships;
* Regulations by international treaties did not apply unless all signatories agree.
Divorce for registered partners followed the same rules as opposite-sex divorces. Registered partners had to meet one of the following residency requirements to form a union: one partner had to be a Danish citizen and be resident in Denmark, or both parties must have been resident in Denmark for two years. Citizens of Finland, Iceland, and Norway were treated as Danish citizens for purposes of the residency requirements. Additionally, the justice minister could order that a citizen of any other country with a registered partnership law similar to Denmark's be treated as a citizen of Denmark.

**Achievements**: The registered partnership law was the world’s first law for the same sex relationship and it led to the achievement of the same sex marriage.

### *Huwelijk tussen personen van gelijk geslacht (Netherlands)*
**Time**: On 1 April 2001

**Content**: Dutch law requires either partner must have Dutch nationality or to reside in the Netherlands. The marriageable age in the Netherlands is 18, or below 18 with parental consent. The law is only valid in the European territory of the Netherlands and on the Caribbean Islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba, but does not apply to the other constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The single legal difference between same-sex marriages and heterosexual marriages is that, in the former case, parentage by both partners is not automatic. The legal mother of a child is its biological mother (article 1:198 of the civil law) and the father is (in principle) the man she is married to when the child is born. Moreover, the father must be a man (article 1:199). The other partner may thus become a legal mother only through adoption. Only in the case when a biological father does not become a parent (e.g. in case of artificial insemination by lesbian couples), both female spouses obtain parental authority automatically (article 1:253sa).

**Achievements**: The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and this law encouraged other countries to enacted laws for the same sex marriage.

### *The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (USA)*
**Time**: On 26 June 2015

**Content**: The Court noted the relationship between the liberty of the Due Process Clause and the equality of the Equal Protection Clause and determined that same-sex marriage bans violated the latter.Concluding that the liberty and equality of same-sex couples was significantly burdened, the Court struck down same-sex marriage bans for violating both clauses, holding that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all fifty states.

Due to the "substantial and continuing harm" and the "instability and uncertainty" caused by state marriage laws differing with regard to same-sex couples, and because respondent states had conceded that a ruling requiring them to marry same-sex couples would undermine their refusal to hold valid same-sex marriages performed in other states, the Court also held that states must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states.

Addressing respondent states' argument, the Court emphasized that, while the democratic process may be an appropriate means for deciding issues such as same-sex marriage, no individual has to rely solely on the democratic process to exercise a fundamental right."An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act", for "fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections."

Furthermore, to rule against same-sex couples in this case, letting the democratic process play out as "a cautious approach to recognizing and protecting fundamental rights" would harm same-sex couples in the interim.

**Effects**:The new law removes the limits on labor mobility that come with states not recognizing gay marriage. If someone's marriage is not recognized in a certain state, then that person's desire to move to that state is weakened by the prospect of economic and legal disadvantages.Since marriage is as much a social thing as it is a legal institution, denying this social rite-of-passage to one group suggests that that group is somehow socially inferior. In the workplace, this nurtures irrational discrimination.

And also, the legalization of the same sex marriage helps overcome the problem of economic under-performance resulting from the mental strain of being an inferior group. There's strong evidence that creating an "inferior class" negatively impacts the economic performance of the LGBT group.

**Achievements**: The term “gay marriage” soon will be a thing of the past and henceforth only be known as “marriage”. President Barack Obama praised the decision and called it a "victory for America".

## Existing Relevant Laws and Codes Prohibit the Homosexual Act
### *The Islamic Penal Code (Iran)*
**Time**: In the 1930s

**Content**: Homosexuality is a crime punishable by imprisonment, corporal punishment, or by execution. Gay men have faced stricter enforcement actions under the law than lesbians.Any type of sexual activity outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. Transsexuality in Iran is legal if accompanied by a sex change operation, with Iran carrying out more sex-change operations than any other country in the world after Thailand. These surgeries are typically partially funded by the state --there have been claims that some homosexual men may have been pressured to undergo them both by government and society.

**Influences**: Same-sex marriages and or civil unions are not legally recognized in Iran. Traditional Iranian families often exercise strong influence in who, and when, their children marry and even what profession they chose.Few LGBT Iranians come out to family for fear of being rejected, abused or turned over to the authorities. No legislation exists to address discrimination or bias motivated violence on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Officially, the Iranian government believes that everyone is heterosexual and that homosexuality is a violation of the supreme will of God.

Traditional Iranian families tend to prohibit their children from dating, as it is not a part of Iranian culture, although this has become somewhat more tolerated, among liberals.In 2004 an independent film was released, directed by Maryam Keshavarz, that examined the changing mores of Iranian youth when it comes to sex and dating.

Gay Iranian couples are often afraid to be seen together in public, and report that LGBT people were widely stereotyped as being sex-obsessed child molesters, rapists, and diseased ridden degenerates.A popular Iranian derogatory slur against is that of a, "evakhahar", typically a very effeminate gay man who seeks casual sex in public.

### *Russian gay propaganda law(the Russia Federation)*
**Time**: On 11 June 2013

**Content**: Article 1 of the bill amended On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development with a provision classifying "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" as a class of materials that must not be distributed among minors. The term is defined as materials that are "aimed at causing minors to form non-traditional sexual predispositions, notions of attractiveness of non-traditional sexual relationships, distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships, or imposing information about non-traditional sexual relationships which raises interest in such relationships insofar as these acts do not amount to a criminal offence." Article 2 makes similar amendments to "On basic guarantees for the rights of the child in the Russian Federation", commanding the government to protect children from such material.

Article 3 of the bill amended the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with Article 6.21, which prescribes penalties for violations of the propaganda ban: Russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 rubles, and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles. Organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days. Foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported. The fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet

**Influences**: According to a survey conducted in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health."President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He went on to say that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was "invented" by the Western media.

### *Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)*
**Time**: In 1938

**Content**: Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.

**Influences**: Section 377A was introduced into the Singapore Penal Code in 1938 to criminalise all other non-penetrative sexual acts between men. Research is currently underway, facilitated by the digitisation of local newspapers in 2008, to fathom the reasons why the colonial administration sought to enact such a law here when there were more pressing concerns in an era when civilised nations were on the brink of the second World War.

Advocates of the repeal often cited reasons of civil liberty, human rights, and increasing scientific evidence that homosexuality was inborn and found in nature.Opponents of the repeal based their arguments on the conviction that to decriminalise homosexuality would result in a breakdown of the family unit, compromise Singapore's position on procreation, and lead to future undesirable scenarios such as the approval of bestiality and paedophila.

Opponents of the repeal also emphasised the wishes of the putative conservative majority to retain 377A. This was despite there being no formal survey or census done specifically on the topic. In various Singaporean online forums, such as Reachand the AsiaOne Forum strong opinions such as homosexuality being a genetic disease, the existence of a militant gay agenda originating from the West, homosexuality being a product of Western decadence incompatible with Singapore, were repeatedly posted. "Conversion treatments", such as those by NARTH, were also recommended.

One of the references cited within Keep377A.com was a research article titled "Singaporeans’ Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men and their Tolerance of Media Portrayals of Homosexuality",written by Benjamin H. Detenber and Mark Cenite of the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University. The article reported findings on the attitudes of Singaporeans towards homosexuals, with an emphasis on the comfort of viewing homosexual acts in the mass media. The conclusion highlighted a significant level of negativity. It was not, however, mentioned in the article whether this negativity translated into a specific desire to criminalise homosexual acts. The objectives of the research also did not involve gauging attitudes relating to legislation.

As of November 2007, neither the research fellows involved, the school, nor Martin Tan had issued any statement regarding this.
